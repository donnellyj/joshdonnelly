I'm Josh Donnelly, a security engineer focused on building and securing scalable, automated cloud environments using cloud-native best practices.</p> <p>Everything in this portfolio was researched, built, and documented by me to demonstrate hands-on expertise and real-world secure infrastructure practices.</p> <p>This portfolio presents a fully integrated, secure cloud system with development, staging, and production environments. It is built to showcase:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) \u2013 Okta, OAuth2, Keycloak</p> </li> <li> <p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) \u2013 Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation</p> </li> <li> <p>Configuration &amp; Hardening \u2013 Ansible, AWS Config, AppConfig, CIS Benchmarks</p> </li> <li> <p>Cloud Architecture Best Practices \u2013 AWS Well-Architected Framework, multi-account, least privilege</p> </li> <li> <p>Kubernetes &amp; Container Orchestration \u2013 EKS, k3s, vanilla Kubernetes</p> </li> <li> <p>Security Monitoring &amp; SIEM \u2013 Wiz, Splunk, Wazuh, Graylog</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Visualization \u2013 Looker, Tableau, Superset, Metabase</p> </li> <li> <p>Risk &amp; Compliance Methodologies \u2013 FAIR methodology, threat modeling</p> </li> </ul> <p>All components\u2014deployment, configuration management, hardened AMIs, CI/CD pipelines, secure IAM, monitoring, cost modeling, and dashboards\u2014are part of one cohesive system. This site serves as the front-end to explore, interact with, and understand the full stack securely and transparently.</p> <p>\ud83e\udded Site Overview</p> <p>This site presents a layered view of the unified system, organized for clarity:</p> <pre><code>\ud83c\udf10 Environments: Overview of Dev, Staging, and Prod environments\n\n\ud83c\udfd7 Infrastructure: Terraform code, architecture diagrams, and automation patterns\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Security &amp; Hardening: System hardening, IAM policies, CIS benchmarks, and Ansible roles\n\n\ud83d\udee1 Security Monitoring: Wazuh/Graylog deployment, alerting, simulated incident detection\n\n\u2638\ufe0f Kubernetes &amp; App Deployments: Cluster configuration, secure deployment of workloads, ingress and network policies\n\n\ud83e\udde9 Applications: Risk management and other workloads deployed securely into the system\n\n\ud83d\udcca Dashboards: Visualizations of logs, metrics, and security signals\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Cost Modeling: InfraCost analysis, AWS Pricing scenarios, and optimization strategies\n\n\ud83d\udc64 About Me: Background, resume, and contact information\n</code></pre> <p>\ud83d\udce6 Source Repositories</p> <pre><code>\ud83d\udd12 Private Infrastructure Repo \u2014 source code, Terraform, Ansible, configs (not publicly available)\n\n\ud83c\udf10 This Site's Source Code \u2014 powered by MkDocs + Material theme\n</code></pre> <p>\ud83d\udca1 Philosophy</p> <p>I built this system to deepen my skills in modern cloud infrastructure\u2014focusing on automation, security, and visibility at every layer.My goal wasn\u2019t just to deploy infrastructure, but to understand how each piece contributes to a secure, maintainable, and observable system.</p> <p>I\u2019m interested in building environments that are not only functional, but defensible, explainable, and built to last.</p> <p>This portfolio reflects the kind of engineer I aim to be: practical, security-conscious, and always evolving.</p> <p>Thanks for visiting! \ud83d\ude4cHave questions or feedback?
