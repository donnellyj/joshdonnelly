☁️ Josh Donnelly | Cloud & Security Infrastructure Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Josh Donnelly, a security engineer focused on building and securing scalable, automated cloud environments using cloud-native best practices.

Everything in this portfolio was researched, built, and documented by me to demonstrate hands-on expertise and real-world secure infrastructure practices.

This portfolio presents a fully integrated, secure cloud system with development, staging, and production environments. It is built to showcase:

- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** – Okta, OAuth2, Keycloak

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation

- **Configuration & Hardening** – Ansible, AWS Config, AppConfig, CIS Benchmarks

- **Cloud Architecture Best Practices** – AWS Well-Architected Framework, multi-account, least privilege

- **Kubernetes & Container Orchestration** – EKS, k3s, vanilla Kubernetes

- **Security Monitoring & SIEM** – Wiz, Splunk, Wazuh, Graylog

- **Data Visualization** – Looker, Tableau, Superset, Metabase

- **Risk & Compliance Methodologies** – FAIR methodology, threat modeling

All components—deployment, configuration management, hardened AMIs, CI/CD pipelines, secure IAM, monitoring, cost modeling, and dashboards—are part of one cohesive system. This site serves as the front-end to explore, interact with, and understand the full stack securely and transparently.

🧭 Site Overview

This site presents a layered view of the unified system, organized for clarity:

    🌐 Environments: Overview of Dev, Staging, and Prod environments

    🏗 Infrastructure: Terraform code, architecture diagrams, and automation patterns

    🔐 Security & Hardening: System hardening, IAM policies, CIS benchmarks, and Ansible roles

    🛡 Security Monitoring: Wazuh/Graylog deployment, alerting, simulated incident detection

    ☸️ Kubernetes & App Deployments: Cluster configuration, secure deployment of workloads, ingress and network policies

    🧩 Applications: Risk management and other workloads deployed securely into the system

    📊 Dashboards: Visualizations of logs, metrics, and security signals

    💰 Cost Modeling: InfraCost analysis, AWS Pricing scenarios, and optimization strategies

    👤 About Me: Background, resume, and contact information

📦 Source Repositories

    🔒 Private Infrastructure Repo — source code, Terraform, Ansible, configs (not publicly available)

    🌐 This Site's Source Code — powered by MkDocs + Material theme

💡 Philosophy

I built this system to deepen my skills in modern cloud infrastructure—focusing on automation, security, and visibility at every layer.My goal wasn’t just to deploy infrastructure, but to understand how each piece contributes to a secure, maintainable, and observable system.

I’m interested in building environments that are not only functional, but defensible, explainable, and built to last.

This portfolio reflects the kind of engineer I aim to be: practical, security-conscious, and always evolving.
